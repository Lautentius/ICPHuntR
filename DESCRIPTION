Description: This package contains a set of functions to import from export tables data of a common 
    ICP-MS Data Analyses software (Agilent MassHunter for 7700x ICP-MS) and generate a tidy tibble.
    A second set of functions imports raw CPS data with the respective meta data by using only the Masshunter Batchfile as an input. Here, no further processing in the masshunter software is needed.
    Later versions will feature further desriptive stats tools  to automatize data anaylses 
    for soil extracts and water samples measured by ICP-MS.
